Melinda K,5 months ago, 1 star ,Waited patiently for 20 minutes to speak with manager at the New Balance Cottonwood location. I was told when I bought shoes that I had 90 days to return with no questions asked. Manager finally motioned me over and before even opening shoe box stated he would not return them. I can only exchange. I stated that is not what employee said when I purchased shoe. Manager began speaking down to me and loudly stated no one would say otherwise. At this point entire store is staring at what’s going on. I calmly told him that I did not appreciate how he was speaking to me. He stated that’s fine. And continued to say he can refuse service to anyone for any reason and no way would he accept a return for any reason. Still speaking loudly and hatefully. I calmly and quietly picked up my receipt and shoes and left. How does a manager get away with speaking to a customer like that?! I was calm and respectful the entire time but he treated me horribly. The shoes are brand new and don’t fit right.,New Balance - Google Maps

There was another employee who could have helped the other couple and the poor guy just stood there doing nothing, looking like he was not valued as an employee. On the plus side, I wasn't sure about spending that much money on shoes and he produced a coupon for $20.",New Balance - Google Maps

David Gallegos,7 months ago, 1 star ,"I simply called this store to check availability of a particular shoe, and the response I got took me aback!  The guy who answered to phone immediately seemed annoyed and angry with me, and just provided terse, useless responses.  He said he didn't have the shoe, and had no idea when he would be getting it in - stating that the store just gets whatever NB sends them.  I asked again if there was some way to predict availability and he said they have ""8 different ways"" to acquire shoes, and if you order through NB it would take 180 days to receive the shoe (continuing with his rude, angry, annoyed tone of voice).  (NOTE - I don't wear an unusual size, and when I checked the NB website, they have plenty of shoes available in the model and size I wanted).  The thing is, I was trying to give business to a local store, but I was met with complete disrespect and rudeness.

Note that the two NB stores in Albuquerque charge full retail for their shoes, are terrible about returns and/or exchanges, and have been consistently poor with their customer service.  You can purchase directly from the NB website for the same price (with free shipping and free returns).  Or better yet, buy your shoes from a different store in town (I have several options I will go to besides the NB stores in Albuquerque).  I believe that the local Albuquerque NB stores are franchise owned, and don't work well with the national NB, so be careful about returns and exchanges.  They apparently just want to get your money, run with it, and don't care if you ever return.",New Balance - Google Maps

CJThomas Rowley,8 months ago, 5 stars ,"I don’t usually write reviews but we were treated so poorly at this store—not sure what their problem is? I’m middle aged reasonably attractive person lol not like I was challenging customer—maybe this will help others not waste their time—I went with my nephew on a Thursday afternoon. When we walked in just one other customer getting “rung up” and while waiting our turn for service (this is not self service place) the clerk sort of growled over to us across the room (several people were now entering) that he had very few sizes in the shoe my nephew was holding to request trying. It was as though he simply did not want to assist us—I asked, “so we can’t try this shoe” (I’m a really nice person) & he said “we have 13s & 14s” & did not say “I’ll be right with you to help you find something else”? Then he told new folks coming in that he would be with them after he helped others he pointed out who’d come in. Rather than make a scene insisting he help us first my nephew said Let’s go—this clerk was just really rude. A woman clerk just stood there without helping either. Maybe they were mad at each other? At least the day we were there, there was a weird, rude vibe. Went across parking lot to Kohl’s & found 2 pair NewBalance (with cheerful clerk’s help finding size!)for less than half the price of socially challenged NB store, yay!",New Balance - Google Maps
Sean G. O'Mara Sr.,8 months ago, 4 stars ,"I was impressed with the foot scan.  However, the store itself, being a New Balance store, is, in my opinion, very expensive.  I have said many times that there is no way I would pay the kind of money for a pair of shoes that I spent today.  Why I didn't walk out, I will never understand.  I love the shoes, don't get me wrong.  But the prices they charge ARE wrong.  Ahhhh.  The land of capitalism.  I'll save a ton next time and buy the same brand at another store. Maybe not the same model, but the same quality for less than half the price I paid today.",New Balance - Google Maps

robert lupton,9 months ago, 1 star ,"Wednesday, January 5, 2022, I went to the New Balance store at Cottonwood Corners in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The manager refused me service unless I gave them my phone number and email. Didn't ask cash, credit or cryptocurrency, just refused to allow me to make a purchase.

While giving the personal information was the alleged reason for refusing service, I felt discriminated against because of my age. I hope that isn't true, but the way the manager and the staff treated me, I believed that they didn't want me wearing their product because I'm a senior citizen. I hope I'm wrong,  but they haven't responded to me about their personal information police, so??

I sent a written complaint to New Balance when I got home- they haven't responded.

Love NB shoes. Made the purchase from Amazon for less money and free shipping. So much for shopping local.",New Balance - Google Maps

O,10 months ago, 1 star ,"If I could rate this store a 0 I would. The lowest rating is  one so I went with that.. Two employees that I dealt with today were not friendly, one was hateful, disrespectful & rude! When I walked in I was not greeted much less addressed. I walked up to the register said hello to everyone while they just stared at me. I asked for help,.I explained to the young man at the register with black hair that I have plantar fasciitis and three heel spurs. I asked which shoe would be better for this? He used his hand pointing to four shoes stating they were for this issue picked up the a shoe so I could look at it on the outside and inside I took out this plastic thing that they had in the shoe so I could feel the cushion in the shoe. I also said I heard that you sell inserts that would be great for plantar fasciitis. He said yes we do I need to measure your foot so we can see what size your foot is. So I said okay what do I do next? He said take your shoes off and I will measure them. I said okay, took off my shoes just sat there while he stared at me. I said what's next, he said now stand over there and I can measure your feet. I said okay and just stood there.  He wouldn't say anything  so I said what's next, he said now he will help you with an inserts.. I said okay. The young man with shoulder length brownish blonde hair, no glasses  turned around and said we will be using our shoe that is your size to fit the inserts so you can see what they look like because we can't put them in your filthy, old dirty shoes. I was shocked by his comment! My shoes were not filthy or dirty they are a little older but they were not dirty. I started putting my shoes on while he went to the back and I told the young man with the black hair I am leaving, he was so rude.  He said ""well he just said that because of covid."" I said ""if it was because of covid, his response should have been ""we are not using the customer's shoes to put inserts in, we have to use our shoes because of covid."" While I was putting my shoes on, the employee that told me about my filthy, dirty,  old shoes bent down, put his face close to mine and said what's wrong? Mind you this is the first time that he actually looked at me in the face. I ignored him and proceeded to walk out of the store. He said don't forget your phone. I was embarrassed, humiliated and very angry! I chose to say nothing because I was not going to allow him to decide how I was going to react to his ignorant behavior.",New Balance - Google Maps

I walked in never owning a pair of NB shoes, and when I asked to see the options I mentioned to him how I’ve been looking at some pairs online that I’d be interested in on Amazon and the website. He rudely assumed I was looking at the “cheaper shoes” that they didn’t carry in store and how I “did not have enough money” by saying that all he carried was the “pricey” options. I planned on spending $150-$200, but he lost a sale due to him being rude and judge mental. I walked right out, don’t go here.",New Balance - Google Maps

I only wore them to my car, drove away and realized something was wrong with them. 10 minutes and back to store, and a hard time. Must be new to return them for you money back, or you must exchange them and not an even exchange either. If you find another pair, they dont credit it against the more expensive pair you originally bought.
Read the fine print. Buyer beware! And service people not afraid to raise their voice to you. Poor salesmanship!

Kyle H,a year ago, 1 star ,"Explicitly states on the receipt that there's a 30 day return policy, yet they will not process any returns. Was charged twice on my purchase, and was given no option to contact a manager or supervisor.

Went to SAS to purchase shoes for work under the premise that $180 shoes would be comfortable. They weren't, so I purchased insoles that the clerk claimed would form to my foot over time. I put on the shoes again at home before realizing I may as well return them and just use the insoles in a different pair since I didn't really like the shoes to begin with. The insoles felt fine at first, but over time became increasingly uncomfortable to the point of causing pain from my ankles up to my hips.

Now, according to the salesperson and other reviews I've just read, I'm out $180 on the shoes because SAS isn't accepting returns under the guise of ""protecting customers from COVID."" It's a business decision that comes across as a thinly veiled lie that reads more like ""Not accepting returns to protect our own money.""

Maybe SAS should protect their reputation instead.",SAS Shoes - Google Maps

NANCY M EBERHARDT,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced!  My father-in-law was misled into believing he could return a pair of shoes if he determined, after trying them on at home, the fit was not to his liking. When I tried to return the shoes for him within the 30 day grace period the manager and owner claimed the shoes were ""worn"" and wouldn't refund his money. These shoes were worn indoors for a few hours by a 90 year old man! Both the manager and owner were exceedingly rude and, in particular, the owner appeared to enjoy having an opportunity to bully a customer. There are several other reviews on Google and Yelp reporting similar experiences and a complaint to BBB, so this behavior is not new. Bottom line, anyone who attempts to return shoes at this store is likely to receive a very nasty response and NO refund. There are many other locations to purchase quality shoes; I suggest you take your business elsewhere.",SAS Shoes - Google Maps

Warman Hall,5 years ago, 4 stars ,"On Saturday, 10/21/2017, I took my mother to SAS Shoes on Juan Tabo to purchase a pair of shoes.  We have been customers of SAS for decades and just recently made a purchase of three shoes in excess of $500 from this same location.  My mother, who now has dementia, found a pair of shoes she liked and the very kind and friendly sales lady helped us.  My mother has a very hard time communicating and does not have the ability to express herself in a very coherent manner due to the dementia.  The sales lady felt the shoes on my mother's feet and said they seemed to be a good fit.  We purchased these shoes.  Later at home, I suspected there may be a problem with the new pair of shoes since she did not want to wear them.   On Tuesday, 10/24/17, at approximately 4:45 p.m. we went to the SAS store with the shoes in the box and the receipt.  We walked in the store and there was a lady and a man behind the counter.  Neither of them acknowledged us.  There were also two sales ladies in the store and they both said hello.  I went to the counter and let the lady and man behind the counter know that we needed to exchange a pair of shoes.  The man took the shoes out of the box and said ""I can't keep exchanging these shoes.""  I told him ""excuse me, what do you mean.""  He just repeated the same thing and he said he'd maybe exchange them once.  I told him that if he looked us up in their computer he would see that we are long standing SAS customers who have never returned or exchanged a pair of shoes.   I told him that we had recently spent over $500 on three pairs of shoes.  He proceeded to tell me that if I ""kept it up"" he wouldn't even exchange them and that I had better be nice to him.  I was shocked that someone would speak to a customer in this manner.  I asked him if he was serious and he said yes.   The sales lady who had helped us with the original pair of shoes then came over and after trying on two different sizes, my mother was comfortable with one two sizes larger then the original pair purchased.  She completed the exchange and we left.
I was disgusted by this man's behavior, his tone, his attitude and his bullying.  The receipt states No Refunds or exchanges on worn or soiled shoes.  No refunds after 30 days.  These were brand new shoes purchased on 10/21/17 and exchanged on 10/24/17.  They were not worn, they were not soiled.  For him to make an issue about exchanging them was inappropriate and fraudulent.  For him to behave in that manner was inappropriate and vile.   Even my mother just kept repeating evil man, evil man on the drive home after this incident.
We will never return to this store, nor buy a pair of SAS shoes solely because of this man.  I have contacted SAS in San Antonio, Texas and BBB to relay this horrible encounter and will also be contacting the New Mexico Attorney General's office.
It should be noted that there are several scathing reviews on Google and Yelp about this SAS Shoes on Juan Tabo due to their exchange/refund policy.",SAS Shoes - Google Maps

Unfortunately they didn't have my size at the store but we tried on another color to find the right size. The other colors were nice but we decided to order it in the black lace. I just received them in the mail and they fit perfectly! I am extremely happy with them. I am glad that they offered ordering the shoes for me and also shipping them to my house.

When I walked in one female was helping someone.    There was on other person in the store.    One female was standing by where you have the cash register.  She said hello when we walked in.   She said nothing else like be with you soon or can I help you.  Look at a few shoes still no response.   So I left it’s taken me this long to say something.

At no time did he tell me that this would be a final sale and I would not be able to bring them back for any reason.

I left with the 990v5 and I couldn't be happier. After wearing them for a few days my knees and back are feeling significantly better. I'll definitely be back to buy more new balance in the future.

She kept claiming that the shoes were wet and that they were ruined. The shoes were not walked on. Neither were they scuffed scratched or ""ruined"". The inside of shoes weren't wet.

I mentioned I needed something good for lateral movement and came in wearing my old pair. They didn't have any cross trainers in stock (no problem with that - it happens - especially with covid) but the lady came back out with  880 running shoes which are explicitly not to be used for lateral movement and have pretty terrible side support (I was even warned aBout this at the store in IL.) I then asked what type of trainers she'd originally recommended and she couldn't give the name of the style so I could order online.  Overall a bummer experience at a very expensive shoe store.

Joseph Wolfe,a year ago, 1 star ,"I wanted a running shoe but the employees at the store kept pushing me to buy me a walking shoe. Eventually, I ended up buying the walking shoe even though I had my heart set on a running shoe. FYI the
heavy and undercushioned walking shoes were terrible for running. Not only did they sell us a walking shoe knowing we needed a running shoe, but they also upsold us as the walking shoe was far more expensive by nearly $80. I only review this place after having recently bought new shoes and having a wonderful buying time somewhere else were employees actually took into account of my needs. As someone who loves buying shoes, I hate this store and would not recommend to anyone. Even before I bought the shoes, they seemed sketchy. I now know this store does not care for their customers, only looking to turn a profit. No morals.",New Balance - Google Maps

N A,a year ago, 1 star ,"Here’s an experiment you can do to determine the validity of the Google reviews for this store: Try giving it a one-star rating—the review will appear as approved and you’ll think it was posted, but log out of Google and you won’t see it any more. Your bad review appears only when Google “knows” it’s you looking. This seems to be a service large corporations can buy from Google—the secret burial of bad reviews--and poorly run franchises benefit from it. It definitely  explains the high average ratings for the super sketchy NB stores in Albuquerque, both of which have the same owners. These stores do not honor the excellent NB return  policy you find at other NB stores. Manager Tracy tells customers to wear the shoes out and to see how they work for a few days, then refuses to accept returns you make less than 24 hours later because she saw you wear the shoes out of the store. The manager on the West Side corners elderly customers and bamboozles them into buying totally unnecessary inserts and models of shoes way more expensive than what they want or need. When I posted about my bad experience with this franchise on my neighborhood listserve 20 people responded in two hours sharing their bad experiences at these stores. They’d all posted negative reviews on Google and thought they were visible to others. They’re not. I’m posting this review from a neutral computer to see if somehow it slips through. Hope it does. This is a bad franchise with unethical practices. You can get far better deals on NB shoes online AND the return policy is honored.",New Balance - Google Maps

Sure they measure your foot with a fancy machine, but tell you absolutely nothing about your measurement.  The questions I asked they could not or would not answer.  Unaware of a return policy not on the receipt, I bought and took them home. I didn’t wear them and attempted to take them back, when a rude manager snapped and said “there’s no returns, there’s a sign on the door”.  She rudely said they were worn, and I told her only in the store, she closed the box and said no returns.

Giovanni Cogginio,2 years ago, 1 star ,"No! Just stay away. This store apparently is a franchise location and is NOTHING like other New Balance locations that I've shopped at in other cities. I was greeted not with ""Hello, how are you today, can I help you find anything?"", but nstead an aggressive sounding tone when I first walked in and from clear across the store saying ""Can I help you?"" as if I were some sort of an invader. The selection was poor, the arrangement of the shoes was sloppy, the knowledge level of the two staff was inadequate and the tone was clearly argumentative as well as aggressive from the moment I walked in and until I left without making a purchase. The neighborhood and shopping center which houses this location is run down. This place is the dynamic opposite of New Balance stores that I've shopped in around DFW, Houston, TX and around Phoenix, AZ. Just dirty. Dirty, dirty. If you're a tourist visiting Albuquerque, NM as I was on this day I can promise you that you'll be way better off waiting until you get back home to purchase your New Balance attire. A disgrace this location is. I was issued a pair of New Balance running shoes on Parris Island, SC in 1996 and I've been a fairly loyal customer ever since. This location however is filth.

I bought shoes for my dad. He was looking for a slip-on shoes, due to his age, and the store owner convinced him to buy this New Balance shoes. He did and then tried to wear it at home but was not easy for him to wear it. So we tried to return the shoes within FIVE DAYS, without wearing shoes at home or outside home, and the store employee and manager will not refund our money back. They said it's used and will only give us store credit. Very unfriendly employees including store manager Tracy. They DO NOT HAVE People skills or any Customer Service skills.

A month later, nice shoes still look great and feel great. I've noticed that my feet don't hurt as much after buying New Balance shoes. I've been buying from the store for several years and like it.

As I said, it's a bit pricey, but I also don't get pain in my feet. I think it's a good value.",New Balance - Google Maps

They will have a shoe wall with approximately 25 selections but in reality it's about 2/3s of the selection 25 shoes. They have 2 or 3 different colors of the same shoe. Come on now why cant they have a larger selecton?? I will drop in again in a few months and hopefully the running shoe selection will be much better..",New Balance - Google Maps

Nicolas S,4 years ago, 4 stars ,"I went in to get 2 pairs of inserts (for plantar fachiates) and ended up buying 2 pairs of shoes, also.  The saleswoman was so nice and suggested I should get a shoe with more cushion and stability.  She said she had 2 shoes that were the best to wear if you walk and stand a lot.  I tried them on and had to buy them both.  They are so comfortable especially with the inserts.  Thank you New Balance!",New Balance - Google Maps

Daren Sonnabend,4 years ago, 5 stars ,"I went into store to purchase a leather cross trainer; after speaking with Todd, he asked if I would be open to a mesh cross trainer; after explaining that I walked daily on talus to paved trails and used a shoe insert; Todd directed me to a cross trainer that was $70 more than my original pick.
These shoes were purchased in January and by April they had ripped and the tread does not work on talus or even light gravel trails because they slip.
The service was quick and friendly but the product did not meet my expectations nor did it measure up to the Sketcher cross trainer.  I feel not just disappointed but my sport needs were not met and for such an expensive purchase that deteriorated within months of purchase.",New Balance - Google Maps

Bernice Brewer,10 months ago, 5 stars ,"The best ADU contractor in the city. We found them during an online search when we were planning to build a secondary dwelling and rent it out to meet our skyrocketing expenses. After interviewing four contractors in total, we decided to go with them because they provided the most competitive bid. The entire crew was polite, professional and each phase of the project went smoothly. Our dedicated project manager was in constant communication with us throughout the way and always readily available to answer the questions and address our concerns. Our new dwelling turned out much more beautifully than we had initially thought. Cannot say strongly enough how much of a pleasure it was to work with these guys on our project. We are really pleased to recommend these folks to everyone for the ADU you may have in your mind.",Kaur ADU Plans & Construction - Google Maps
